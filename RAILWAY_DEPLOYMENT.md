# 🚀 Railway Deployment - No Docker Needed!

## ✅ **Railway Handles Everything Automatically**

Railway automatically detects Python and installs all dependencies. You don't need Docker for Railway deployment!

---

## 🚀 **Deploy to Railway (3 Steps):**

### **Step 1: Push to GitHub**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "WebRTC deployment ready"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Connect to Railway**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your repository
5. Railway automatically:
   - Detects Python
   - Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`
   - Runs `app_webrtc.py`
   - Sets up WebSocket support

### **Step 3: Get Your URL**
Railway will give you a URL like: `https://gymjam-ai-production.up.railway.app`

---

## 🔧 **Railway Configuration (Already Done):**

### **`railway.json`** ✅
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "cd backend && python app_webrtc.py",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health"
  }
}
```

### **`nixpacks.toml`** ✅
```toml
[phases.install]
cmds = ["pip install -r backend/requirements.txt"]

[start]
cmd = "cd backend && python app_webrtc.py"
```

---

## 📱 **Deploy Frontend to Netlify:**

### **Step 1: Update WebSocket URL**
In `frontend/webrtc-script.js`, change:
```javascript
// Change this line:
this.socket = io('http://localhost:5000');

// To your Railway URL:
this.socket = io('https://your-railway-app.railway.app');
```

### **Step 2: Deploy to Netlify**
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Drag and drop your `frontend` folder
3. Your frontend will be live at: `https://your-app.netlify.app`

## 🎯 **Environment Variables (Optional):**

In Railway dashboard, you can set:
```bash
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
```
